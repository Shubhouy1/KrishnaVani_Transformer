# KrishnaVani_Transformer
A transformer-based conversational AI trained on the Bhagavad Gita for spiritually coherent dialogue generation.

## 📖 About the Project
KrishnaVani is a **GPT-style chatbot** designed to simulate meaningful conversations inspired by the wisdom of the **Bhagavad Gita**.  
It leverages **transformer-based deep learning models** and modern **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to provide spiritually aligned responses that blend **ancient philosophy** with **cutting-edge AI**.

##  Features
- 🔹 Transformer-based GPT architecture (36 layers, 774M parameters)  
- 🔹 Fine-tuned on the Bhagavad Gita (verses + commentaries)  
- 🔹 Generates **spiritually meaningful and context-aware dialogue**  
- 🔹 Customizable inference (temperature, top-k sampling, etc.)  
- 🔹 Supports research in **AI for spirituality, philosophy, and ethics**
